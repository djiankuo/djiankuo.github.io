I am an lecture in School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT).

I received the B.E. degree from the Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJUPT), and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, USAS) in 2014 and 2019, respectively. 

My research interests lie in the general area of cryptography and security, particularly in applied cryptography, cryptographic engineering, cryptographic testing, and evaluation, as well as high-performance cryptographic computing. My publications include TECS, IPDPS, SCN, WASA, etc.

My job focuses on applying cryptography in reality. Parts of my achievements include:
* High-performance cryptographic servers (20Mops+ of digital signature and FIPS 140 certificated). 
* Secure and fast software cryptographic implementations (numberous publications and implementations).
* Cryptography evaluation methods (2 fundamental standards, i.e., GB/T 37092 and GB/T 39786).
