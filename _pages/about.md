I am a assitant researcher in Institute of Information Engineer, Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (IIE-CAS). I am also the Chief Engineer of Testing Lab in DCS center, CAS.

My research interests lie in the general area of cryptographic and security, particularly in applied cryptography, cryptographic engineering, cryptographic testing and evaluation, as well as high-performance cryptographic computing.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and received my PhD in University of Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (UCAS).
